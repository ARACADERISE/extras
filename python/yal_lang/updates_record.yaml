    - info:
      - The application will go through each file and take out each .yal file
      - Had problems importing one .yal file into another? No need anymore!:
        - all files are compiled at once. This makes it to where you don't need to import one .yal file into another .yal file
        - Think of it like this:
          - 2 files are the application, full of function, classes, etc, and then you have a rendering .yal file where
          - all you have to do is call the class-function or the function, !NO IMPORTING
