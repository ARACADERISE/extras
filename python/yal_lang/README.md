# Yal Language

****The YAL Language(Yet Another Language) is a language based off of Python and its compiler****
### What does it offer
****yal offers many easy-access-keywords. Don't think of yal as a easier and faster programming language****
<p>Yal is just another language that is compiled into the Python compiler, and is computed as a Python application</p>
<h1>Why did I make it then?</h1>
<p>I have always wanted to make a language. I had seen many other people make interesting languages using Python. So, I decided to make a language of my own</p>

# How does it work
*Note: The yal language is of the same syntax as Python, but many key-ideals within the language of Python are different within the language yal*
*Also note: yal is not a actual language. You cannot just write, or create, a project of the file type .yal. </br> In order to write a program in the yal language, you have to create a python project, import os, then write the command:</br>***os.system('git clone https://github.com/ARACADERISE/extra/python/yal_lang****
